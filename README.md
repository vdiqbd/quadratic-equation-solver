# quadratic-equation-solver
Input the value of a, b, and c. It solves it and if it can't, it will tell you.

'QuadraticEquationSolver1.py' uses the quadratic formula to solve the equation. It breaks down the steps from the formula and applies them in order.
'QuadraticEquationSolver2.py' uses the general format of a quadratic equation. It has two functions to run if the value of 'c' is positive or negative.

Both will run the same way and give the same answers, although the code are completely different.
You can input any equation, it will solve it and give you the answer. If it can't, it will tell you.
